# CS465-fullstack

Architecture:
  Within the website that I created, we tried out many different frontend development processes. The Express HTML was more simple and plain looking, the JavaScript allowed for an easy transition between the pages. My favorite was the SPA, it looked good and allowed for an easier readability for the user. In the backend we used NoSQL MongoDB database, which I think is a simple database to use. It allows for an easy storage of data, and it works well with node and angular.
  
Funcionality:
  JSON is text only, it is pretty simple and you can code the JSON in other programming languages. However, JSON is close to JaveScript, so JSON data can be converted to JavaScript objects pretty easily. We used this for things such as the title or header. Also with the trips we used this to have certain data for each section of the trip.
   
Testing:
  In my testing my project, I would test to make sure that when I added my trips it would add into the trips list and in Mongo. Also there is the developer tools option in the browser that allows you to see your code and that helped me find some errors as well. 

Reflection: 
  I always wanted to be able to create my own website. I took Web Design in High School and we only used HTML within a notepad, so we didn't get too much information. However, it does help knowing HTML already as I can do alot of the design work. This class helped me be able to add more functionality to my website, which will be very helpful for my future.
